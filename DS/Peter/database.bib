  abstract = {Provided certain obstacles are overcome, we believe Cloud Computing
	has the potential to transform a large part of the IT industry, making
	software even more attractive as a service and shaping the way IT
	hardware is designed and purchased. Developers with innovative ideas
	for new interactive Internet services no longer require the large
	capital outlays in hardware to deploy their service or the human
	expense to operate it. They need not be concerned about over-provisioning
	for a service whose popularity does not meet their predictions, thus
	wasting costly resources, or under-provisioning for one that becomes
	wildly popular, thus missing potential customers and revenue. Moreover,
	companies with large batch-oriented tasks can get their results as
	quickly as their programs can scale, since using 1000 servers for
	one hour costs no more than using one server for 1000 hours. This
	elasticity of resources, without paying a premium for large scale,
	is unprecedented in the history of IT. The economies of scale of
	very large-scale datacenters combined with ``pay-as-you-go'' resource
	usage has heralded the rise of Cloud Computing. It is now attractive
	to deploy an innovative new Internet service on a third party's Internet
	Datacenter rather than your own infrastructure, and to gracefully
	scale its resources as it grows or declines in popularity and revenue.
	Expanding and shrinking daily in response to normal diurnal patterns
	could lower costs even further. Cloud Computing transfers the risks
	of over-provisioning or under-provisioning to the Cloud Computing
	provider, who mitigates that risk by statistical multiplexing over
	a much larger set of users and who offers relatively low prices due
	better utilization and from the economy of purchasing at a larger
	scale. We define terms, present an economic model that quantifies
	the key buy vs. pay-as-you-go decision, offer a spectrum to classify
	Cloud Computing providers, and give our view of the top 10 obstacles
	and opportunities to the growth of Cloud Computing.},

  title = {Online cost-efficient scheduling of deadline-constrained workloads
	on hybrid clouds},
  year = {2013},
  abstract = {The use of cloud computing has found broad acceptance in both industry
	and
	
	research. Public cloud oerings are often used in conjunction with
	privately
	
	owned infrastructure in a so-called hybrid cloud. Technical aspects
	such as
	
	impact of network latency, bandwidth constraints, data condentiality
	and
	
	security, as well as economic aspects such as sunk costs and price
	uncertainty
	
	are key drivers towards the adoption of such hybrid clouds. Deciding
	which
	
	workloads to outsource to what cloud provider in an organization with
	a hybrid
	
	cloud setup is a complex problem. This decision should maximize the
	
	utilization of the internal infrastructure and minimize the cost of
	running
	
	a partition of the total workload on one or multiple public cloud
	providers,
	
	thereby taking into account application requirements such as deadline
	or
	
	budget constraints, security constraints, data requirements or bandwidth
	
	constraints. Such decisions are generally hard to take by hand, because
	
	there are many cost factors, pricing models and cloud provider oerings
	to
	
	consider. In this work, we tackle this problem by proposing a set
	of heuristics
	
	to cost-eciently schedule deadline-constrained computational applications
	
	on both public cloud providers and private infrastructure. Our heuristics
	
	take into account both computational and data transfer costs as well
	as delays
	
	due to network latency. We evaluate the performance of the proposed
	
	preprint submitted to Future Generation Computer Systems July 17,
	2012
	
	heuristics in a realistic setting with regard to the realized cost
	savings and
	
	deadlines met, and reckon with the inaccuracy of the user provided
	runtimes
	
	necessary to build a consistent and ecient schedule.},

	become more accessible to a wide range of consumers. Deciding
	
	which workloads to outsource to what cloud provider in such
